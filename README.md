A Home Assistant integration for adding custom Tuya categories without waiting for Core to update.
This code Home Assistanmt Core pull request and to allow quick additon of more devices.


This was originally a fork of lasry1/home-assistant-tuya-custom (https://github.com/lasry1/home-assistant-tuya-custom). I bought a 2 valve timer and with the fork from lasry1 I was able to get only one valve to work.

This requires some external steps to be completed in order to work (up to step 5 only)
